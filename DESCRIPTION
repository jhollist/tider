Description: Values such as Higher High, High, Low, etc are commonly used in
             the analysis of tide data.  While predicted and measured values
             are available for many locations, it is common to measure water
             levels with data loggers.  This package parses the values from the
             common data loggers and returns the commonly used tidal
             measurements.
